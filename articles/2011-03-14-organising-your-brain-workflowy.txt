One of the things I've been doing lately is trying to figure out what to do with all the free time I have since I quit World of Warcraft.
It's been amazing to go to the gym, work on learning new stuff and build this blog.
One of the other things I've been doing is starting to actually follow through on some of the business ideas I've been collecting.

This has led me to try to find out if there's a better way to organise my thoughts.
There is and I'll introduce it to you:

http://workflowy.com/

It's a site that is a list.
An infinite list consisted of infinitely many sub-lists.
It's amazing and really really simple:

<object width="480" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qPMVtkNrquU?fs=1&hl=en_US&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qPMVtkNrquU?fs=1&hl=en_US&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="390"></embed></object>
