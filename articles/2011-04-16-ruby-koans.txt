I finally finished the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).
It may sound really stupid but they are amazing for teaching you extra stuff you should probably know about ruby, stuff like inject, lamdas and blocks, message passing, overring method_missing and other really cool "tricks" that let you code Ruby better.

For fun I pushed my finished answers onto github.
If you're horribly interested you can see them at: https://github.com/lengarvey/ruby_koans.
I've also got the code for this blog up there (although as I state in the readme I'd really recommend most people use something more awesome).
