title: 2013 Resolutions
date: 09/01/2013

Over the past few years I've been setting goals for myself, and achieving most of them
but it becomes easy to weasle out of some goals if they aren't written down. So in the
spirit of [@awws](https://twitter.com/awws)'s post [2013 New Year's Resolutions](http://blog.tundramonkey.com/2013/01/07/2013-new-year-s-resolutions)
I've decided to write up my goals for the year and post them publically.

Health
------

Towards the end of last year I got a personal trainer (Rebecca of [Becompetitive Fitness](http://www.becompetitivefitness.com) is amazing)
and started my fitness journey. I lost [~6kg over 2 months and put on a bit of muscle](http://i.imgur.com/UH1eB.jpg).
More importantly than the numbers I broke my Coca-Cola habit, and established new routines which
involve me going to the gym multiple times per week. I found myself sleeping better and experiencing
less ups and down related to sugar levels. I've still got a bit of work to do here (cutting out all sweets for instance).

So my goal for this year is to step it up a notch:

1. Lose 15kg. (Actually I'd like to hit this by June but it would be pretty close to my goal weight)
2. Keep an average of 4 exercise sessions per week.
3. Cut out the afternoon and after-dinner sugary treats. I'll be able to incoporate dessert into my weekly cheat meal instead.
4. Take up a martial art.

Overall I just want to be able to feel good about my fitness and health. One more thing that I'm doing
is taking up a martial art. I've decided to give Krav Maga a go and have booked an induction session
for later this month.

Personal
--------

Last year I travelled through Western Europe with my lovely girlfriend, capping off the trip with 3 days
snowboarding in the Dolomites.

This year I'd like to do some more snowboarding, and to plan (but possible not execute) my next big trip.

1. Spend at least a week snowboarding.
2. Plan the next big proper holiday.
3. Get on top of my financial situation. This is already in progress with another housemate moving in shortly.

Professional
------------

In 2012 I made a huge change in my career moving firmly into a Rails focused role as Lead Developer
for [Airtasker](https://www.airtasker.com). I also taught a Ruby on Rails focused course for
General Assembly at the end of the year.

1. Start contributing to an Open Source project.
2. Pick up some small contract work outside of work hours.
3. See where the Airtasker ride takes me over the year.
4. I'd really love to teach again.
5. Continue to participate in the Ruby community going to events like [RoRo](http://ruby.org.au/meetups/syd.html), [Railscamp](http://railscamps.com/) 
and the upcoming [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org.au/).

Overall I feel that my fitness goals are going to be the most challenging, but they're also my most important
ones for this year. Last year I really changed up my professional life with a big job change, focusing heavily
on Rails and web development, and then teaching later in the year.
