Welcome to Bottled Goodness.

I intend on posting interesting software development stuff. 
One thing some of you may notice is that this blogging software 
doesn't look like anything you may have seen before. 
It isn't! I've coded this simple blog (which I've called sloggr) 
up over a few days using a few cool tools I've been playing with.

Sinatra
MongoDB
MongoMapper
and of course, Ruby!

The next couple of articles I'll go through my experiences using these tools.
